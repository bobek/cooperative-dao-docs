# 💡 The Funding Cooperative DAO

{% hint style="success" %}
The Funding Cooperative DAO is a new approach to help founders while increasing dramatically the number of qualified web3 founders. Founders and DAOs accepted as members of the Funding Cooperative DAO receive a shared token in return for a small portion of their tokens. This creates diversification, jump-starts community creation, and provides some liquidity as well.  Gains are recycled into outreach and education, focusing especially on underrepresented groups. &#x20;

## Why do Founders and DAOs apply?

Many of us _are_ founders - and have _personally_ experienced the challenges of starting companies, open-source projects, and DAOs. At the Funding Cooperative DAO we do NOT solve all of these challenges. However we can, with your help, address:

#### Diversification: &#x20;

* Investors have diversification - we think Founders and their DAOs should as well.

#### Liquidity:

* Our shared tokens are attractive to investors as a way to cost-effectively gain exposure to quality founders and to participate in the often outsized gains as founders go from 0 to 1. &#x20;

#### Community:

* By becoming a part of a DAO of DAOs established by the Funding Cooperative DAO - DAOs link arms with each other and support each other on their journey.&#x20;
