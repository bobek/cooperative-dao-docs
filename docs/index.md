# 💡 The Funding Cooperative DAO

!!! info ""

    The Funding Cooperative DAO is a new approach to help founders while
    increasing dramatically the number of qualified web3 founders. Founders and
    DAOs accepted as members of the Funding Cooperative DAO receive a shared
    token in return for a small portion of their tokens. This creates
    diversification, jump-starts community creation, and provides some
    liquidity as well. Gains are recycled into outreach and education, focusing
    especially on underrepresented groups.

## Why do Founders and DAOs apply?

Many of us _are_ founders -- and have _personally_ experienced the challenges of
starting companies, open-source projects, and DAOs. At the Funding Cooperative
DAO we do NOT solve all of these challenges. However we can, with your help,
address:

### Diversification

- Investors have diversification - we think Founders and their DAOs should as well.

### Liquidity

- Our shared tokens are attractive to investors as a way to cost-effectively
  gain exposure to quality founders and to participate in the often outsized
  gains as founders go from 0 to 1.

### Community

- By becoming a part of a DAO of DAOs established by the Funding Cooperative
  DAO -- DAOs link arms with each other and support each other on their
  journey.
